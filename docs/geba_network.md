# GEBA

The Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA) is a database for the central storage of the worldwide measured energy fluxes at the Earth’s surface, maintained at ETH Zurich (Switzerland). Many of the historical records extend over several decades. GEBA contains monthly data from a variety of sources, namely from the World Radiation Data Centre (WRDC) in St.Petersburg, national weather services, different research networks (BSRN, ARM, SURFRAD), peer-reviewed publications, project and data reports, and personal communications. GEBA is publicly accessible [online](http://www.geba.ethz.ch). Supplementary data are also available [here](https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.873078). An overview of the measurement locations is presented in the figure below.

Distribution of the 2500 locations with observational data contained in GEBA. Red symbols indicate locations with at least one monthly entry in GEBA; yellow symbols signify locations with multiyear records (at least three years of data) [source](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-9-601-2017).

The following parameters can be obtained from GEBA:

* Global radiation (shortwave incoming)
* Direct solar radiation
* Diffuse solar radiation
* Albedo
* Reflected shortwave radiation
* Longwave incoming radiation
* Longwave outgoing radiation
* Longwave net radiation
* Radiation balance
* Sensible heat flux
* Latent heat flux
* Subsurface heat flux
* Ultraviolet radiation
* Absorbed shortwave radiation
* Circumglobal radiation 

It should be noted that not all the measurement locations are still in operation and have all the parameters available. Additionally, most locations only measure global horizontal radiation. Unfortunately, GEBA does not provide information on the instrument used to measure solar radiation components, so the user can't estimate the quality of the data.
